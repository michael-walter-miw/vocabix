# 📘 Vocabix – Usage Guide

Welcome to **Vocabix**, your personal vocabulary trainer. This app helps you to collect, train, and test vocabulary pairs between two languages.

---

## 🧭 Navigation Overview

Vocabix is structured into **three tabs**:

1. **📝 Erfassen** – Manage your word pairs
2. **🎯 Trainieren** – Practice with instant feedback
3. **🧪 Prüfung** – Take a full test with result statistics

---

## 1. 📝 Erfassen – Wortpaare verwalten

Here you can:

- ➕ **Add new** word pairs
- ✏️ **Edit** existing entries
- ❌ **Delete** unwanted word pairs
- 🔀 **Sort** the list alphabetically by language 1 or 2
- 📥 **Insert example data** for quick testing
- 🧹 **Reset all data** (with confirmation)

All changes are **automatically saved** to your browser's `localStorage`.

> 💡 You can also prepare word pairs first, then train or test them in the other tabs.

---

## 2. 🎯 Trainieren – Wörter üben

In the training tab:

- You'll be asked to **translate a word** in either direction
- Type your answer and click **"Prüfen"**
- You’ll get **immediate feedback**:
  - ✅ if correct
  - ❌ with the correct answer if wrong
- The system will prioritize **incorrectly answered words more often**

> 🧠 This helps reinforce your weaker vocabulary first.

## 3. 🧪 Prüfung – Wissen testen

In this mode:

- All (or a subset of) words are asked **in random order and direction**
- You enter your answer without hints
- At the end, you see a **result table** with:
  - Your answers
  - Correct answers
  - A total score and **percentage hit rate**

⚠️ While you're in a test:
- The other tabs (**Erfassen** and **Trainieren**) are **locked** to prevent distractions
- Use the **"Zurück"** button to exit the exam mode manually

> 💡 The test simulates a realistic exam environment.
